I'm Viach Kakovskyi (Ukrainian: Вячеслав Каковський), a backend software engineer, technical leader of a geo-distributed team, [speaker](/talks){:target="_blank"} and reader :). I live, work and enjoy BBQ in [Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas){:target="_blank"}, Tech Capital of [The Lone Star State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas){:target="_blank"}.

As a **backend software engineer**, I've been focused on the development of [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging){:target="_blank"} software, [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load){:target="_blank"} data services, [Near-Real Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing#Near_real-time){:target="_blank"} embedded system for road traffic analysis, network applications for [CCTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television){:target="_blank"} video systems. Far ago and long away I was working on [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce){:target="_blank"} solutions as a full-stack web developer.

Today Python is the main programming language for me. I also have a bit of commercial production experience using Java, Ruby, PHP, Perl, and JavaScript.

As a **technical leader** I've coordinated work of several teams:
- geo-distributed American-Ukrainian (and sometimes Australian) team; my awesome current one.
- built and led a team of Python developers from scratch for a company focused on video surveillance. I was the first Python engineer joined the company.
- partnered with [Misha Behersky](http://bmwlog.pp.ua/){:target="_blank"} for [KPIdata](http://results2016.kpidata.org){:target="_blank"} - a social project for accessing the quality of higher education in [Kyiv Polytechnic Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky_Kyiv_Polytechnic_Institute){:target="_blank"}. The team was expanded to 10 core members and eventually, 180+ individual contributors helped us to deliver the project. We really enjoyed that effort and gave 50+ swag items to the community. Good times!
- at the [department](http://pzks.fpm.kpi.ua/){:target="_blank"} where I was studying Software Engineering, we had various course projects in groups of students. I had the honor to lead teams of my classmates and I believe that it helped to build a good foundation for our collaborative skills.

As a **speaker**, I occasionally give [talks](/talks){:target="_blank"} at Texan and Ukrainian Python events. It helps me to structure my knowledge and get feedback about the approaches which I follow. And, you know, I just enjoy it. Interesting, but when I was in school I had a fear of public speaking. To develop the skill I gave 40 public speeches over a year during studying in university. So, do not fear, just do it!

I adore of **reading** technical books. I've recently started using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59728448-viach-kakovskyi){:target="_blank"} as the reading list. I publish detailed review and notes of the most interesting books [here](/tag/#books){:target="_blank"} in the blog. Feel free to suggest me a book about computers.

I have very deep theoretical and practical interest in data storages. I hold an MSc Honours degree in Software Engineering and wrote master's thesis on topic *"Database structure refactoring method for the speeding up SQL queries processing"*.

Other areas of my professional interest are:
- asynchronous programming
- distributed systems
- highload projects
- load testing and gaps analysis
- monitoring and troubleshooting
- performance optimizations
- technical mentoring

Therefore, in the blog, you should expect posts on the topics described above.


I send **monthly summaries** with my findings of backend software engineering. I can add you to my mailing list if you wish. Let me know which things about backend engineering are the most exciting for you.
