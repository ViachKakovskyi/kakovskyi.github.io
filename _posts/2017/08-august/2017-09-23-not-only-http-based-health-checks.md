From the very childhood all we know that we should care about our health. Make morning exercises, keep posture straight, sleep well, avoid extremely spicy food, do not drink too much, ... a long list of good things. People omit some of the items. Because of "reasons". Especially young people.

And we would regret when it's already too late, but annual health checkups help us to be on the same page with out body. Thankfully to that we can consider risks for our health in time and eventually start eating less BBQ :).

Today software vendors must develop reliable products if they want to be competitive tomorrow. Our customers expect us to provide services due to declared [SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement){:target="_blank"}.

Health Checks serve us as the tool to identify availability issues in our services on the early stages, even before a customer notices that. Implementation of Health Checks for HTTP-servers is an interesting problem with well-known solutions.

Let me share my finding about designing the checks for not HTTP based backend services.
