From the beginning of the 2017 year, I was thinking about starting a blog. I had a few options for the main subject:
- BBQ
- Burrito
- Backend

Since I love all these things it was not the easy decision for me and it took half of the year to make it.

Tasting BBQ and Tex-Mex cuisine in _the best places in Texas_ convinced me to do not intervene into the competitive businesses. I will just continue consuming the delicious and not-always-healthy food.

A warm welcome to the blog about Backend Software Engineering!

What's "backend" all about?
-

Well, what's the word "backend" about? It has numerous meanings for different people, like:
- Something without JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- An HTTP-server
- Data access layer of an application
- Database, server-side framework, server, and operating system
- Software which runs on the LAMP stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP
- Cloud services (we will talk sometimes what's _cloud_, okay?)
- Code is written in scripting languages like Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP
- Everything a user can't see in the browser
- Just anything except frontend even might include hardware
- ...

You see that it's hard to pick the one and the only one which fits your mind.
Therefore, I wanna introduce my very own definition of **backend** term which is used in the blog:

**Backend is the part of software which is executed not on the device of an end user.**

From my perspective, it includes, but not limited to:
- HTTP APIs
- Web servers
- Data storages
- Data processing services
- Software for testing other software
- Infrastructure for software deployment and monitoring
- Cloud services (someday I will share my definition of _cloud_, right?)

And I expect to add more things to the list over the years. Stay tuned.

What's the blog about?
-

The [Howdy](/about-me/){:target="_blank"} page claims that I'm a backend software engineer, technical leader of a geo-distributed team, [speaker](/talks){:target="_blank"} and reader. I do the things and I yearn to do it better.

I believe that blogging will help me to organize my thoughts and accelerate learning. Also, I assume that my experience in backend software engineering might be useful for other members of the community and as a consequence will lead to interesting discussions.

In the blog you can expect to read:
- Thoughts about the approaches which we apply at work with my team. We're involved in the development of instant messaging software. I'm passionate about that.
- Introductory posts about the backend technologies which I learn and plan to use in the future. I will do my best to make them enough practical for y'all. With examples.
- Reviews of the events which I attend and occasionally speak for.
- Abstracts of my technical talks.
- Reviews of the books about computers which I read and found alluring. With spoilers :)
- **You can [tell me](/about-me#subscribe){:target="_blank"}** what you wanna read here. I'm pretty open to new ideas.

The target audience for the blog is:
- Backend software engineers
- Software engineers interested in improving backend skills
- Engineers which tend to lead small or mid-size teams
- Any person which interested in learning about Backend. Or burrito. Or BBQ.

I plan to write at least a post per week and send monthly updates. Don't forget to **[subscribe](/about-me#subscribe){:target="_blank"}** to my mailing list.

How does the blog work?
-

This is a static one built with Jekyll and hosted at GitHub Pages.
I appreciate **[Yegor Bugayenko](https://github.com/yegor256/blog){:target="_blank"}** and **[Juliano Boesel Mohr](https://github.com/juliaaano/juliaaano/){:target="_blank"}** for providing the great examples.

Okay, guys, let's start our first discussion. What's your own definition of **backend**?
